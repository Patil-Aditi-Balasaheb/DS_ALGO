'''
A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
It is also known as a proper binary tree.

            Full Binary Tree

Full Binary Tree Theorems:
let, i = the no. of internal nodes
     n = be the total no. of nodes
     l = no. of leaves
     & = no. of levels

1. The number of leaves is i + 1.
2. The total number of nodes is 2i + 1.
3. The number of internal nodes is (n - 1) / 2.
4. The number of leaves is (n + 1) / 2.
5. The total number of nodes is 2l - 1.
6. The number of internal nodes is l - 1.
7. The number of leaves is at most 2 raise to (Î» - 1).
